  Steps for Responsiveness To make the web page responsive, the following steps were implemented: 
  1. *Flexbox Layout:* Used flexbox to create a flexible layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
  2. 2. *Media Queries:* Applied media queries to adjust styles based on the screen width. Breakpoints were set at 768px for tablets and 480px for mobile devices. 3. *Flexible Images:* Ensured images are responsive by setting their width to a percentage and using max-width: 100%; to prevent overflow.
3. 4. *Fluid Grid Layout:* Utilized a fluid grid layout for the features section, allowing the boxes to wrap and adjust based on screen size.
 5. 5. *Test and Iterate:* Tested the web page on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it looks great and functions well on all of them.
